## Technical Implementation

### UFM Data Flow
```
Data Sources (DB) → Transform to UFM Findings → Apply Filters → Sort → Display in FindingCard
```

### Filter Architecture
- **State Management**: React hooks for filter state
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering with memoization
- **UX**: Clear visual feedback with badges
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

### Pro Feature Pattern
```typescript
// Feature gate example
const handleProFeature = () => {
  if (!isProUser) {
    setShowUpgrade(true);
    toast({ 
      title: "Pro Feature", 
      description: "Feature description",
    });
    return;
  }
  // Execute pro feature
};
```
