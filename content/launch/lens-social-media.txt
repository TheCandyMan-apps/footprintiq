OPTION 1 (Direct)
-----------------
Finding profiles is easy.
Knowing which ones matter is the hard part.

That's why we built LENS.

OPTION 2 (Problem-Solution)
---------------------------
OSINT tools return results.
LENS explains reliability.

Public data. No monitoring. No certainty theater.


OPTION 3 (Privacy-First)
------------------------
LENS doesn't track people.
It explains evidence.

OPTION 4 (Credibility Focus)
----------------------------
Most OSINT tools tell you what they found.
LENS tells you why you should care.

Confidence scoring for investigators who need clarity, not volume.

==========================================

1/ The hardest part of OSINT isn't finding data.

It's knowing which results to trust.

2/ Username matches across 47 platforms mean nothing if 40 are false positives.

We built LENS to solve this.

3/ LENS is a confidence-scoring layer that explains:
• Why a result appears
• How reliable the attribution is
• What signals support or weaken it

4/ It doesn't search. It analyzes.

Takes raw OSINT output → returns confidence bands:
Strong | Likely | Weak | Insufficient

5/ No monitoring.
No certainty theater.
No black-box scores.

Just transparent, explainable confidence.

6/ We wrote up the methodology here:
footprintiq.app/blog/lens-introduction

And you can try it on any scan:

OPTION 1 (For Decision-Makers)
------------------------------
OSINT tools are excellent at finding data.

They're less good at explaining which results actually matter.

If you've ever reviewed a scan showing 50+ platform matches and wondered "how many of these are actually the same person?" — that's the problem we set out to solve.

LENS is our answer. It's a confidence-scoring layer that analyzes public signals and explains:
• Why a result appears
• How reliable the attribution is
• What evidence supports or weakens it

No black-box scores. No certainty claims. Just transparent analysis for investigators who need clarity.

We wrote up the methodology here:

OPTION 2 (Thought Leadership)
-----------------------------
The question isn't "did we find something?"

The question is "should we trust it?"

That's the gap we've been thinking about at FootprintIQ. Raw OSINT results are useful, but they require interpretation. Context. Judgment.

Today we're introducing LENS — a confidence-scoring system that explains reliability, not just returns results.

Public data only. No monitoring. No surveillance.

The full methodology is here:

Curious what others in investigations and security think about confidence scoring in OSINT.

TITLE: Built a confidence-scoring layer for OSINT results — looking for feedback

I've been working on OSINT tooling for a while and kept running into the same problem: username searches return dozens of matches, but verifying which ones belong to the same person takes longer than the search itself.

So we built something called LENS. It analyzes public signals across results and returns a confidence score with explanations — not just "match found" but "here's why we think this is or isn't the same person."

Uses things like:
- Username consistency patterns
- Platform context (registration dates, activity patterns)
- Cross-platform corroboration
- Signal contradiction detection

No monitoring, no login bypass, public data only.

Wrote up the methodology here if anyone's interested in the technical approach:
footprintiq.app/blog/lens-introduction

Would love feedback from people who deal with false positive fatigue in their workflows.


==========================================
REDDIT — r/privacy
==========================================

TITLE: Question: How do you think about "ethical OSINT"?

Working on OSINT tools and thinking a lot about the ethical boundaries.

Our take: public data is fair game for analysis, but there's a big difference between "helping someone understand their own exposure" and "enabling surveillance."

We built a confidence-scoring system that explains evidence quality without:
- Monitoring capabilities
- Login bypass or private data access
- Certainty claims (we use probability bands, not definitive statements)

Curious what this community thinks about where the ethical lines are. Is confidence scoring useful, or does any OSINT tooling feel problematic regardless of constraints?

Not trying to promote anything — genuinely interested in the discussion.


==========================================
REDDIT — r/netsec / r/cybersecurity
==========================================

TITLE: Confidence scoring for OSINT — reducing false positive noise in investigations

One of the more frustrating parts of OSINT workflows is the false positive rate. Username searches especially — you get 30-50 platform matches but maybe 5-10 are actually the same person.

Built a confidence layer that tries to address this by scoring attribution strength based on:
- Signal consistency
- Platform metadata correlation
- Contradiction detection
- Evidence corroboration

Returns confidence bands (Strong/Likely/Weak/Insufficient) with human-readable explanations instead of black-box scores.

Technical writeup: footprintiq.app/blog/lens-introduction

Anyone else working on similar problems? Curious how other teams handle result verification at scale.
