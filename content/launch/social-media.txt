1/6 🧵 We're launching Persona DNA today — the most advanced privacy-first identity correlation engine ever built.

Here's what it means for OSINT 👇

2/6 Traditional tools show isolated data:
❌ john@email.com found in 3 breaches
❌ @johndoe on Twitter
❌ johndoe.com registered 2015

Persona DNA connects them:
✅ All 3 belong to same person (87% confidence)
✅ Maps full digital identity
✅ Zero PII stored

3/6 Use cases we're already seeing:

🔍 Fraud teams: Link fake accounts to prevent $47K+ in losses
🛡️ SOC teams: Flag high-risk employees before they click phishing links
⚖️ Legal: Generate court-admissible Evidence Packs in 1 click

4/6 Privacy commitment:
• Publicly available data only
• Cryptographic hashing (no raw PII)
• Real-time computation (no data retention)
• GDPR Article 25 compliant
• Annual third-party security audits
