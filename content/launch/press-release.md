## FootprintIQ Launches Persona DNA and Evidence Packs: The Future of Privacy-First OSINT Intelligence

**San Francisco, CA — January 15, 2025** — FootprintIQ, the leading privacy-focused digital footprint intelligence platform, today announced the Atlas Expansion, introducing three groundbreaking features that transform how security teams, fraud analysts, and investigators understand digital identities.

### Key Innovations

**Persona DNA** — A privacy-preserving identity correlation engine that maps connections between email addresses, usernames, domains, and online accounts, creating a comprehensive "digital fingerprint" without storing personally identifiable information (PII).

**Predictive Risk Index** — An AI-driven risk scoring model (0-100) that evaluates breach history, exposed credentials, suspicious patterns, and persona fragmentation to predict security threats before they materialize.

**Evidence Packs** — One-click forensic reports (PDF/JSON) that bundle all OSINT findings, Persona DNA graphs, risk assessments, and remediation guidance — perfect for compliance audits, legal proceedings, and incident response.

### Industry Impact

"The Atlas Expansion represents a paradigm shift in OSINT intelligence," said the FootprintIQ Team. "Traditional tools show isolated data points. Persona DNA connects the dots while respecting privacy. Our customers are already using these features to prevent fraud, accelerate investigations, and meet compliance requirements."

Early adopters report:
- **60% reduction** in incident response time
- **$47K+ in fraud prevention** through linked account detection
- **20+ hours saved** per legal case with forensic-ready Evidence Packs

### Privacy-First Architecture

Persona DNA operates on publicly available data and cryptographic hashing — never storing raw PII. All correlations are computed in real-time and can be purged instantly. FootprintIQ's infrastructure is GDPR Article 25 compliant (privacy by design) and audited annually by third-party security firms.

### Availability

All three features are available today via FootprintIQ's web platform and REST API. Free tier includes 10 scans/month. Pro tier ($49/month) offers unlimited scans and API access. Enterprise solutions with white-label, SSO, and SLA guarantees available.
