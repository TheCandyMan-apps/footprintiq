## YouTube Short Scripts

### Short 1: "What is OSINT?" (60 seconds)

**Script**:
```
"What even is OSINT?"

OSINT = Open Source Intelligence

It's gathering information from publicly available sources.

Think:
• Social media profiles
• Public records
• News articles
• Forums and blogs
• Data breaches
• IP addresses

Why it matters:
→ Security teams detect threats
→ Investigators solve cases
→ Journalists verify sources
→ Companies do due diligence

The problem? It used to take HOURS using dozens of tools.

That's why we built FootprintIQ.

All the best OSINT tools in one place.

Free to try. Link in description.

Questions? Drop them below 👇

### Short 2: "Live Demo" (60 seconds)

**Script**:
```
"Watch me investigate someone in real-time"

[Shows screen]

I'm going to search this username: techguru42

Enter it into FootprintIQ...

Click "Start Scan"...

And watch what happens:

✓ Found Twitter - verified account
✓ Found GitHub - 200+ repositories  
✓ Found Reddit - active in 15 subs
✓ Found LinkedIn - CTO at tech company
✓ Found Medium - tech blogger
✓ Found personal website

All in 45 seconds.

Now AI gives me a briefing:

"Technology executive with 10+ years experience. Active open source contributor. Strong online presence matches professional identity."

That would've taken me 2 hours manually.

### Post 1: r/OSINT Launch

**Title**: Launching FootprintIQ - All-in-One OSINT Platform (Free Tier Included)

**Body**:
```
Hey r/OSINT!

After lurking and learning from this community for years, I'm excited to share what we've built.

**What is FootprintIQ?**

An all-in-one OSINT platform that integrates 20+ tools you probably already use separately:
- Maigret
- Sherlock
- SpiderFoot
- Hunter.io
- HIBP
- AbuseIPDB
- And 14 more

**Why another OSINT tool?**

I got tired of:
1. Opening 15 tabs for one investigation
2. Copy/pasting targets everywhere
3. Manually correlating results
4. Building reports from scratch

So we built a unified platform with:
- One search across all tools
- AI-powered correlation
- Automatic reporting
- Real-time alerts

**Pricing:**

FREE tier: 50 credits/mo, 10 providers
PRO: $29/mo, unlimited scans, all providers

**For this community:** Use code REDDIT2025 for 50% off

**Try it:** https://footprintiq.app

Would love your feedback. What features would make this more useful for your workflows?
