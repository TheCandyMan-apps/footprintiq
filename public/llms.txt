# FootprintIQ

> FootprintIQ is an ethical digital footprint scanner that uses open-source intelligence (OSINT) methods to help individuals understand where their personal information appears online. It scans usernames across 500+ platforms, detects email breaches, identifies data broker listings, and provides probability-based confidence analysis through LENS (Link & Evidence Network System).

## Important Notes

- FootprintIQ only accesses publicly available information
- It does NOT monitor, track, or conduct surveillance on individuals
- All scans are user-initiated and results are not stored or sold
- LENS provides probability-based analysis, not identity confirmation
- The platform is designed for personal awareness and education, not investigation of others
