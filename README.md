# Welcome to your Lovable project

## Project info

**URL**: https://lovable.dev/projects/93bce7e7-a3f9-4ffb-8036-32425962a83f

## üìò API Docs & Launch Blog

FootprintIQ now includes comprehensive API documentation and a launch blog post:

- **[API Documentation](/docs/api):** Complete REST API reference with authentication, endpoints, and examples
- **[Persona DNA Launch Blog](/blog/persona-dna-and-evidence-packs):** Announcement of Atlas Expansion features

Both pages are fully SEO optimized with structured data, OG tags, and canonical URLs.

## üîê Environment Setup

Before running the application, set up your environment variables:

1. **Copy the example file:**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Fill in required values:**
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Anon/public key (safe for client)
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID` - Project identifier
   - Optional: `VITE_APIFY_API_TOKEN` for username scanner

3. **Never commit secrets:**
   - `.env` files are git-ignored
   - Pre-commit hooks block `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` and `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - Only `VITE_*` variables are exposed to the browser

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Checklist

### Row-Level Security (RLS)
- ‚úÖ RLS enabled on all tables with user data
- ‚úÖ Policies use `auth.uid()` for user isolation  
- ‚úÖ Security definer functions prevent recursive checks
- ‚úÖ Admin access via `user_roles` table (never client-side checks)
- ‚úÖ Regular audits via `/admin/rls-check` page

### Environment Variables
- ‚úÖ Public keys prefixed with `VITE_` (client-safe)
- ‚úÖ Secret keys never committed (`.gitignore` + pre-commit hooks)
- ‚úÖ Config validated at boot (`src/lib/config.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint at `/functions/v1/health`

## üîå Provider System

FootprintIQ uses a unified provider framework with 20+ data enrichment APIs:

- **Circuit breakers**: Automatic 60s cooldown after 5 consecutive failures
- **Rate limiting**: Token bucket (30 calls/min per provider)
- **Caching**: Per-provider TTL-based caching
- **Quotas & budgets**: Daily quotas (500 calls) and monthly budgets (¬£50)
- **Policy gates**: Dark web (`ALLOW_DARKWEB_SOURCES`) and enterprise toggles
- **Unified Finding Model (UFM)**: Standardized output across all providers

### Admin Console
- `/admin/providers` - Configure and monitor all providers
- `/admin/observability` - Real-time metrics dashboard
- `/admin/rls-check` - RLS policy verification

### Verification
```bash
npm run verify:providers
```
Generates HTML report at `verification/providers-report.html`
